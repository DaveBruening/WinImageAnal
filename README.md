# WinImageAnal
I made this Windows Forms App, which uses Azure AI Vision to identify objects in pictures
It's based on https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/how-to/call-analyze-image-40?tabs=csharp&pivots=programming-language-csharp  , which uses a console app.  I added some features, like allowing the user to select an image, drawing rectangles around identified images and putting caption text in labels.
